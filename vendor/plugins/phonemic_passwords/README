PhonemicPasswords Plugin for Ruby on Rails - Version 0.2

    PhonemicPassword.generate(length=8)

    Used to create random passwords that are somewhat memorable for people. Uses
    random phonemes along with some knowledge of vowels, consonants, dipthongs and whether
    they should not come first or last in an English word. Not perfect by any means, but
    I consider it an improvement over the library that inspired it (Ruby/Password)
