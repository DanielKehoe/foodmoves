LiveTree is very alpha.

* It has only been tested with Firefox 1.0.4, Internet Explorer 6, and Opera 8 under Windows XP.
* There are sometimes issues when the same part of the tree is undergoing multiple data retrievals.
  This doesn't happen very often, though.
* No doubt there are some bugs.

However, it does seem to work and be useful!

See TODO[link:files/TODO.html] for a list of items I intend to implement.
