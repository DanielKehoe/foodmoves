RealButtons
===========

A mixin to allow you to use the <button> tag in forms rather than the 
non-stylable <input>-base dsubmits we're all used to!

Consists of two methods

real_button_to      replaces    button_to
button_submit_tag   replaces    submit_tag

To use simply replace the call to the helper in your view. The arguments 
are the same.
