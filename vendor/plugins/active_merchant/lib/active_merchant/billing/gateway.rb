  module Billing #:nodoc:
    # 
    # == Description
    # The Gateway class is the base class for all ActiveMerchant gateway implementations. 
    # 
    # The list of gateway functions that concrete gateway classes can and should implement include 
    # the following:
    # 
    # * <tt>purchase(money, creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>authorize(money, creditcard, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>capture(money, authorization, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>void(identification, options = {})</tt>
    # * <tt>credit(money, identification, options = {})</tt>
    # 
    # == Setting Up Your Gateway
    # Aside from the obvious authorization parameters (login and password), you can set up your 
    # gateway using numerous options. Be sure to reference your gateway of choice's documentation 
    # before overriding it's default values that may be defined.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.default_currency</tt>: sets the default currency if none is provided. See 
    #   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes for active currency codes.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.supported_countries</tt>: sets the countries of _merchants_ the gateway supports.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.supported_cardtypes</tt>: sets the card types supported by the gateway.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.homepage_url</tt>: sets the URL at which the gateway may be found.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.display_name</tt>: sets the name of the gateway for display purposes, such as generating documentation.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.application_id</tt>: This is the application making calls to the gateway. This 
    #   is useful for things like the Paypal build notation (BN) id fields.
    # 
    # * <tt>Gateway.money_format</tt>: this attribute may be set to <tt>:dollars</tt> or 
    #   <tt>:cents</tt>. Use this to set the expected money format you'll be inputting.
    #
    # 
    #     Gateway.money_format = :dollars # => 12.50
    #     Gateway.money_format = :cents   # => 1250
    # 
    # 
    # == Testing Your Code
    # There are two kinds of tests performed with your code: local and remote.
    # 
    # === Local Tests
    # Before running any remote tests, it's best to ensure that your code covers the basics 
    # locally. Local tests run on your own machine and will run faster than remote tests.
    # 
    # To run a local test, first ensure that your gateway is in test mode: 
    # 
    #   ActiveMerchant::Base.mode = :test
    # 
    # (See ActiveMerchant::Base for more details.) This is often best set in your test's +setup+ 
    # or +teardown+ methods, if you are using Test::Unit.
    # 
    # The next step is to use one of three test credit card numbers: 
    # 
    # <tt>1</tt>:: Result will be successful
    # <tt>2</tt>:: Result will be a failure
    # <tt>3</tt>:: Result will raise a miscellaneous error
    # 
    # For examples of test requests, please see your gateway of interest's unit test code.
    # 
    # === Remote Tests
    # Remote tests aren't mandatory, but it's not a bad idea to write them to ensure everything 
    # works as expected. You'll first need authorization parameters from the gateway you'll be 
    # working with. Once you have these values you'll be able to use ActiveMerchant to run test 
    # requests.
    # 
    # As with local tests, first ensure that you are in test mode: 
    # 
    #   ActiveMerchant::Base.mode = :test
    # 
    # (See ActiveMerchant::Base for more details.) 
    # 
    # Test requests may then be made using appropriate parameters provided by your gateway of 
    # choice. For instance, the Moneris gateway provides a test MasterCard and Visa number that 
    # one may use to process test purchases and authorization requests.
    # 
    # Given that these remote tests will take longer to run than local tests, it is recommended 
    # that you comment them out, or disable them when not required.
